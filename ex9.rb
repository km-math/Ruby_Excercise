# Here's some new strange stuff, remember type it exactly.

# Assign values to variables
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
# Here we use \n to make new line
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

# Displaying the values along with string
puts "Here are the days: #{days}"
puts "Here are the months: #{months}"

# Here we use %q new method to display a pragraph
puts %q{
There's something going on here.
